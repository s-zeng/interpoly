# interpoly
Small CLI Polynomial Interpolation Tool

README still in TODO phase. In the meantime, you can run `main.hs` with GHC(i) - 
the core functionality is all there, save for some clean up and extra CLI features.

Still mostly incomplete - large amounts of work left to do before this is release ready.
